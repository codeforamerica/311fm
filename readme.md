311 is a common service in many cities to report non-emergency service requests. Broken streetlights, potholes, and graffiti are a few examples of reportable issues via 311.

[Open311](http://open311.org) is a specifcation for reporting and retrieving service requests via an API.  

311 FM is the place where you can tune into your service requests anytime! You can find out whatâ€™s going on in your city based on Open311 service requests and view it any way you want to: on a map, in a table, just pictures, and even a compare view.
